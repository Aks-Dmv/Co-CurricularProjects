ARVD - Deciding to put a ICD or not
How I did it

we perform queries by making some things observed and then seeing their effect
We are going to create a decision tree that includes our utility functions such that we come to the MAP decision
    we should finally decide whether to put the device or not
deterministic CPD's are those whose output is only dependent on the inputs
    thus no probability needed we can directly assert the output
Decision nodes are deterministic because we donâ€™t want to give two identical patients with identical symptoms different prescriptions 
U has its parents as its .var
