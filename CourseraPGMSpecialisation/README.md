# Coursera_PGM_Specialisation

![alt text](PGM.jpeg)  

This repository has all the files I used to pass the assignments of the Coursera course conducted by Daphne Koller. It was a very challenging course and I had quite an exhilarating experience. The code is organised chronologically instead of alphabetically.  

The code was heavily commented beforehand and my task was to fill in the code at the required places, which was a challenge in itself.  

There are even text files in some folders that I wrote while I was coding in order to consolidate my thoughts. These can provide insights into my thought process and also how you should think in order to pass the assignments.
