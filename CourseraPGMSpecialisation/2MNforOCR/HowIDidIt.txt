MN for OCR (actually CRF)
How I did it

goal: build the diagram
given: Code for inference of the network
given: the Map algorithm
PHIc is the factor linking the vector node to classifying node
PHIp is the factor linking two classifier nodes
PA3Data has allWords which has many words which has many letters which have two attributes 1) 1-26 which character 2) sample image
to access we do allWords{i} or allWords{i}(j)
PA3Model has imageModel has basically params which is used to calculate character solely based on image (singleton factors)
next it has pairWiseModel which is a 26x26 matrix that makes PHIp
next is triplet list that contains triplets for making PHIp
PA3SampleCases and PA3TestCases are self explanatory
given: we got a logistic regression model that gives us vector K whose i element is that characters score
to write ComputeSingletonFactors code
done
i did it by taking the computeImageFactor and returned a factor with var as the image index in the word and the cardinality as 26
starting with inference
that will be handled later
computing equal pairwise factors now
basically we said that any two letters are equally likely next to each other
now we should calculate the actual things from the matrix in the pairwise matrix
basically it is just transferring values using the index to assignment command
similarly for triplet but here the triplets data base doesnâ€™t have 26*26*26 values
it just has 20,000 important ones
so accordingly we transferred the 20,000 into their correct places
