# Co-CurricularProjects
These are a few selected projects that were done during my undergraduate years. You can think of them like capstone projects. Some of these courses are online courses, while some are on-campus courses. I have given a brief intro to each of these projects below. If you want more details regarding any one, just click on the respective directories.





## The Projects

Each of the following directories have all the required code required for running the application as well as a README.md file.  

* [AIProjectTicTacToe_QLearner](https://github.com/Aks-Dmv/Co-CurricularProjects/tree/master/AIProjectTicTacToe_QLearner)
* [CourseraPGMSpecialisation](https://github.com/Aks-Dmv/Co-CurricularProjects/tree/master/CourseraPGMSpecialisation)
* [CustomMIPSProcessor](https://github.com/Aks-Dmv/Co-CurricularProjects/tree/master/CustomMIPSProcessor)
* [udacityAI4Robotics](https://github.com/Aks-Dmv/Co-CurricularProjects/tree/master/udacityAI4Robotics)


# A brief explanation of each of the projects

## [AIProjectTicTacToe_QLearner](https://github.com/Aks-Dmv/Co-CurricularProjects/tree/master/AIProjectTicTacToe_QLearner)  

#### This project is basically a proof of concept where I show that with limited compute power and a low-enough-dimensional action space, we can create human competitive bots that pick the right action after a few hours of training. The program is a terminal based application as shown in the picture below.

### The application is based on a table based Q-learning approach. This method will not scale for higher dimensional action spaces. If you want to see how to use neural networks for Q-learning, see my [AI_Concepts](https://github.com/Aks-Dmv/AI_Concepts) repository.  

### Going back to the Q-learning bot, if you play badly, you might even lose to the bot.

## [CourseraPGMSpecialisation](https://github.com/Aks-Dmv/Co-CurricularProjects/tree/master/CourseraPGMSpecialisation)  

#### I took this specialization course when I was very young, and I owe everything to this course. It was a very challenging course and is the sole reason why I am comfortable with AI. This is Daphne Koller, the instructor for the course.

### This course has 9 programming assignments which we had to write in MATLAB. Each directory has a well written pdf file which explains the background of the problem and what you have to do.
### Disclaimer: I am not trying to help students cheat. These are just my insights. 

1. BN Knowledge Engineering
2. BN Genetic Inheritance
3. MN for OCR
4. ARVD Test
5. Exact Inference
6. Sampling Methods
7. CRF Learning for OCR
8. Classification Of Poses
9. Model Actions

### So, if you want to check it out, then go ahead.

## [CustomMIPSProcessor](https://github.com/Aks-Dmv/Co-CurricularProjects/tree/master/CustomMIPSProcessor) 

#### This group project was 40% of our grade. I learnt quite a bit after doing this project, especially how to work as a team. This was part of the Computer Architecture Course I took at BITS. All we were given were the following two pictures.

### We had to decide on our own how we were to approach and code up the problem. We first saw a few lectures online and also a few tutorials. After that we finally gravitated upon a solution, it was on the one shown below. We had a few more constraints to worry about, so our architecture is a bit more complex.

## [udacityAI4Robotics](https://github.com/Aks-Dmv/Co-CurricularProjects/tree/master/udacityAI4Robotics) 

#### I took up this project because I liked its final capstone project. I thought the biggest take-away would be that final robot capture project; however, it turned out that the actual biggest take-aways were the concepts I learnt. Sebastian Thrun's (we have to give credit to the udacity platform, as well) pedagogy is really quite impressive. I have linked some snapshots below.

### This is the Robot Runaway final project. The robot is going in a circle, as indicated by the green dots, and the pursuiter is chasing it, indicated by the red dots. The reason that they are dots, and not lines is because we are working at discrete time steps and therefore have plotted the position of the target and the pursuer at those timesteps.
