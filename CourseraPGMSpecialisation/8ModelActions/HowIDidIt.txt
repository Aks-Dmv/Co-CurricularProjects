How I did it

We just implemented the EM algorithm to complete the missing data pieces

Basically, it can be thought of like a gradient ascent
Both algorithms have a direction determining step, then they move their positions along that direction and finally they repeat for the new position

Drawbacks- same as GA

Can we use SVM?
Yes, the idea is that we group based on distances based on hyper coordinates
SVM would give better results
But, basically the SVM algorithm works in the same way

We want to classify the action into a class. So, we are given an action and we are told that we want the class. i.e.. argmax(P(c|a)) where we iterate among the c.
P(c|a)=P(a|c)P(c)/P(a)
and we know that P(c) and P(a) are constants
the good thing because of this is that we can easily find argmax(P(a|c)) where we iterate over c
imagine somebody telling you that this dude is clapping, what is the probability of him putting his hands close together?
this is easy.
Now, what if we had to find the class given the action, ex. his hands are close by, what is he doing?
This is much tougher.

Why are we using HMM?
Because we have a sequence. The leg is going up, hits something and then goes back down. This is why we need HMM. We need some sort of state system.

What do we do in Recognise action?
